A senior member of the Tshiozwi branch of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of South Africa (ELCSA), Gogo Phophi Mashango Masuka (89), was laid to rest in the Tshiozwi cemetery on Saturday. She died two weeks ago at her home after a long illness. Her burial on Sunday followed a service at the church, which was attended by many members of the church and a huge group of community members. A senior member of ELCSA, Ms Eunice Doboro, urged members to emulate the good example set by the gogo. “We worked together for a long time and I can testify that Masuka was a selfless and trusted senior member of the church who worked tirelessly for God. She was a disciplined member who spoke her mind when things were not going well in the church," she said. The grandson of the gogo, Mr Takalani Masuka, described his grandmother as an angel who brought up grandchildren with love and affection. “We wipe our tears, knowing that she served the Lord every minute of her life. God has done his will and ours is to accept.”
