Hundreds of mourners paid their last respects as well-known veteran taxi driver Mr Luvhilo Ramashidzha (51) was finally laid to rest at the Madombidzha graveyard on Sunday. Ramashidzha worked as taxi driver for more than 25 years and passed away in the Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital last Monday after a short illness. Family spokesperson Mr Mavhungu Ramashidzha described his death as a big loss to the family. "He was one of a kind, a unique person who was always ready to help each member of his family and whoever came to him for help. We have lost a great man," he said. Ramashidzha said the deceased had played a uniting role in the family and they had all looked to him as an example. On behalf of Sadiki transport, Mr Mike Mamburu said that they ran short of words to express their pain after the death of one of their hardworking drivers. “He worked tirelessly for the development of this company and his contributions will remain for all to see. We have really lost a giant who was always in the forefront of our struggle for better service to our clients. We will miss him dearly." The public relations officer of Dzanani II Taxi Association, Mr Mathuba Mudau, said that his association was saddened by the death of one of their own. "Ramashidzha was a pillar of our association and nobody will ever replace him." Ramashidzha is survived by his wife and four children.
