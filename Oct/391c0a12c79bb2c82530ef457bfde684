One of Vhembe’s “big trees”, the sculptor George Magonya (80) of Madabani, died after a long illness at the Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital last Thursday. Magonya was a pioneer in the development and education of sculptors in the area and he served as a role model to many. According to his grandson, Mr Rofhiwa Magonya, his grandfather made a significant impact on the lives of many people. He was also someone who loved and enjoyed life. “My grandfather had a big heart. As a family, we are still feeling the loss. His death left a very deep pain in our hearts,” he said. Rofhiwa described Magonya as a pioneer, a born leader and a man of vision. He was a very solemn, restrained and dignified man. “For many years he served selflessly and faithfully in different communities, created employment for many families and in dark days he made himself available day and night to all who needed him,” Rofhiwa added. "It is painful to lose an intelligent father, but we thank God, because He does everything for a reason. May his soul rest in peace,” he said. Magonya will be buried on Saturday at Madabani cemetery. The service will start at 06:00 at his home.
