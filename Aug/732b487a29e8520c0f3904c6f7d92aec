A 26-year-old man, Tshimangadzo Tambani, was found guilty in the Thohoyandou High Court of killing his girlfriend and the mother of his three-year-old son. On 7 August, it was testified in court that Tambani had killed Glenda Radzilani on 31 July 2017. The incident had taken place at the deceased’s home in the morning at Madombidzha village in the Sinthumule area. The Limpopo regional spokesperson for the National Prosecution Authority, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, said that Tambani had pleaded guilty. In his plea, he admitted to having killed Glenda. He stated that he went into the deceased’s house to fetch his son, so that he could walk him to the crèche as usual. However, he and the deceased suddenly engaged in a heated argument in the presence of the deceased’s younger sister, aged 19. “The accused stated that he became angry, took a knife and stabbed the deceased several times all over her body until she died,” said Malabi-Dzhangi. The accused was subsequently found guilty by judge F Khomo and his case was postponed to 28 August for a pre-sentence hearing and victim impact reports, as well as sentencing.
