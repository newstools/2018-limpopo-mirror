The family of Ms Takalani Tshilamulele, who was found murdered in a bush next to the bridge at Ravele a fortnight ago, has thanked the police for arresting the suspected killer. The police have confirmed that they had arrested the boyfriend of the deceased, Vhutshilo Mashige (30), in connection with her death. Mashige had been on run since the incident but was later brought to the police by his mother. Tshilamulela was buried last Saturday at the Ravele Cemetery. Mashige appeared in the Tshilwavhusiku Magistrate’s Court last week and the case was postponed to January 2019 for a formal bail application.
