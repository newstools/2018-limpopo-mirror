Grade 12 pupils of three schools in the Madombidzha area will benefit from a recent donation by the OVH Company, who donated science kits to the schools. The donations were presented during a science exhibition by the OVH and are aimed at encouraging pupils to pursue careers within the fields of science. The beneficiaries are Maluta, Litshovhu and Jonathan Thifhulufhelwi Secondary Schools. The motivational speaker, Ms Humbelani Netshandama, said that parents should make sure that the pupils do their work during their free time at home. She pointed out that the pupils should also devote some of their time to schoolwork, instead of spending all their time having fun. She said that many companies wanted to finance hardworking students. “No matter where you come from, hard work will always be rewarded,” she added. An organiser of the exhibition, Mr Eric Mulovhedzi, said that they wanted to motivate pupils to study hard. "We want to motivate pupils to stick to education and advise them not use drugs and alcohol," he said. Mulovhedzi emphasised the various opportunities in the different fields of study. “The guidance campaign aims to expose the youth to various economic sectors and introduce skills-facilitation programmes,” he said.
