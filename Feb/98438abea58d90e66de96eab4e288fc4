A disabled granny of 103 years could not stop smiling after she received a new wheelchair during an event at Louis Trichardt last Thursday. Gogo Vho-Mudzunga Makhoba of Ha-Mphaila in the Nzhelele area received the wheelchair from community builder Mr Daniel Lavhelani. Before receiving the wheelchair, she had to crawl when she wanted to move around. Lavhelani said he was touched by the plight of the disabled granny as she did not have a proper wheelchair. “I have done so many things for my community, maintaining what the Bible says that the left hand should not know what the right is doing. This time around I decided to come out into the open to encourage those who are blessed to think about the poor who are near them.” The grandson of the gogo, Mr Azwitamisi Phophi, did not have enough words to thank Lavhelani for his generosity. "It is hard to find good people like him in these days when everybody strives for himself.."
