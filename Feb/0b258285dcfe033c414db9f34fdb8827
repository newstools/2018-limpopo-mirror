The Congress of South African Students (Cosas) in the Vhembe region commended the work done by the region's leaders for having an interest in the education of the youth. The newly elected chairperson, Mr One-Man Baloyi, said that it was quite encouraging to see the leadership taking a lead in the back-to-school campaign by visiting several schools in the region to encourage learners to start their work on a serious note. Baloyi said education was a catalyst that could change the lives of the poor in the region and that was why they were serious about this issue. Special mention was made of Vhembe's executive mayor, who dedicated much of her time at the beginning of the academic year to visiting different schools and motivating the learners. "We also would like to convey our sincere gratitude to the premier of the province, Mr Stan Mathabatha, who made education a 100% priority.” Cosas Vhembe region has also taken a decision to support ANC Vhembe Women's league chairperson Ms Florence Radzilani as their preferred candidate in the upcoming ANC Limpopo conference for the position of deputy chairperson.
