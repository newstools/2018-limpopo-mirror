Two suspects who allegedly killed a police officer in October last year will remain in custody. Hangwelani Mulovhedzi and Khathutshelo Nemutandani allegedly shot and killed Lt-Col Phineas Mamatsiari at Dzwerani. They appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court last Wednesday and the case was postponed to 26 April for further investigation. Lt-Col Phineas Mamatsiari had just arrived home from work when he was attacked at Dzwerani outside Thohoyandou. The two suspects allegedly stole Mamatsiari’s unmarked police vehicle after shooting him but were cornered when they reached Thohoyandou.  A shoot-out ensued between the suspects and the police. Mulovhedzi was arrested while Nemutandani allegedly escaped. During the shoot-out, Const Livhuwani Budeli was shot and wounded. Nemutandani was on the run for three months before he was arrested two weeks ago. The two men now face five charges, including murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and the possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition.
