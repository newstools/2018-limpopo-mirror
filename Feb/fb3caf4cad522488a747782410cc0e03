The murder case against the 26-year-old Tshimangadzo Tambani was postponed to 5 March for further investigations. He appeared in the Tshilwavhusiku Magistrate’s Court last Wednesday. This was supposed to be a bail hearing, but the matter had to be postponed after the public prosecutor said that the DNA results were still pending. He argued that the court was unable to proceed with the bail application without the results' being available. Tambani stands accused of killing his girlfriend, Glenda Radzilani, on 31 July 2017. It is alleged that he assaulted her on her way to work and dragged her to her home. According to the State, he continued to assault her and then stabbed her multiple times. Two minors and Glenda’s sister were in the house, hiding and fearing for their lives. So far, the community of Madombidzha village has handed a memorandum to the court manager in which they want the court to refuse bail for Tambani. On Wednesday, the local ANC Women's Forum showed strong support for the deceased when they attended the court in a bid to oppose bail.
