The Dzanani Magistrate’s Court denied bail on Monday for two suspects facing charges of murdering a professional nurse. The case was postponed to 16 February (today) for the bail application to continue. Tshilidzi Simethi (53), husband of the decseased, and a friend, Tsundzuka Hlengani (27), are accused of killing Ms Ester Semithi (46) on 18 January. The incident happened at Raliphaswa village. Before their appearance, a crowd of protesters had gathered outside the court, shouting slogans and calling for the accused not to be given bail. The placard-carrying crowd started their march from the local streets before reaching the court. Cllr Germina Rashamuse said they had come to make it clear that they were opposed to the accusers’ being granted bail. She said the residents were very angry and if the accused were released, their safety could not be guaranteed.
