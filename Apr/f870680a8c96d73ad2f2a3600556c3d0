After losing their match against Witbank Spurs last weekend, Black Leopards have a mammoth task ahead of them this weekend. They must beat Richards Bay FC at the Thohoyandou stadium tomorrow afternoon to keep their promotional playoffs hopes alive. The fact that Bay are one of the relegation candidates is reason enough for Lidoda Duvha not to expect an easy victory. The Kwazulu-Natal side are lying in the second last position on the log while Leopards are still in the second spot despite last weekend’s defeat. The coach of Richards Bay, Mr Jean Loscuito, has a point to prove tomorrow. The Belgian mentor was the head coach for Black Leopards for one season before parting ways with Lidoda Duvha for Richards Bay at the beginning of the current soccer season. Siphelele Mkhulise, Mumuni Abubakar and Khayelihle Shozi, the former Leopards’ midfielders, also want to prove to their former employer that Leopards committed a suicidal blunder by releasing them at the end of last season. On the other hand, the Leopards’ goal poachers, Ivan Mahangwahaya, Thembisani Nevhulamba and Karabo Tshepe are expected to keep the Bay’s defenders running for cover throughout the game. Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila will be away to Super Eagles at the Goble Park Stadium in Bethlehem, while Mthatha Bucks must beat Jomo Cosmos or else they will need a miracle to escape the relegation axe at the end of the season. The rest of the weekend’s NFD fixtures are Mbombela United vs Uthongathi FC, Real Kings vs the University of Pretoria, Cape Town All Stars vs Highlands Park, Ubuntu Cape Town vs Royal Eagles and Stellenbosch FC vs Witbank Spurs.
