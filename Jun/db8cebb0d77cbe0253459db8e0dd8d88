Contrary to widespread speculations, the Thohoyandou Stadium will be ready to host the Premier Soccer League games when the PSL’s activities for the new season start in the second week of August. This was said by the manager of sports and recreation in the Thulamela Local Municipality, Mr Ronald Makhadi, early this week. According to Makhadi they had held a meeting with Prof Ronny Scholtz, the head of technical services in the Premier Soccer League, last week. During the meeting Scholtz pointed out some of the areas which should be attended to before the stadium could meet the required standard to host PSL games. Makhadi said that Scholtz advised them to pay special attention to the pitch. Scholtz was concerned about the fact that the pitch was over-utilized last season. That was caused by the fact that two local teams, Black Leopards and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, shared the same stadium for their matches throughout the season. Makhadi further indicated that Scholtz also advised them to build an additional ablution block, because Black Leopards have huge support. Apart from the ablution block and the pitch, Scholtz also raised dissatisfaction about the entry points to the stadium. Scholtz advised them to erect 20 turnpike gates to make access to the stadium much easier during big games. When asked as to whether the PSL’s technical team were asking too much from the municipality, Makhadi was quick to point out that there was no reason for the local football lovers to press the panic buttons, because they had almost two months to carry out Prof Scholtz’s instructions. Makhadi stated that they had held a meeting with the other stakeholders on Monday this week. According to him the meeting agreed that the areas which Scholtz had pointed out was not far-fetched. “We are working hard to ensure that the stadium meets all the requirements before the end of next month,” said Mr Makhadi.
