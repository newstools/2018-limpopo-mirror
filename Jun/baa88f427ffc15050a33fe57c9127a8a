International beauty pageant host Ms Shandukani Masindi of Tshirolwe Extention 2 in Nzhelele came out fuming this week. This follows a report in this paper on another local beauty pageant host who claimed that his charges competed internationally and that they had competed in Lesotho, where they had qualified to compete in Dubai in July 2018. Masindi (28) of the Miss SA Toddlers Beauty Me pageant, said that she was the only international host based in the Vhembe area. "I read with dismay about this man, whom I have never met before, who claims that his contestants went as far as Lesotho and that they also won there. I am not boasting, but the truth is that I am the only local host who has international products and this man is just busking on the credit that is not due to him." She asked the other "promoter" to stop with the accusations, "before I take him to task."
