Well-known soccer administrator and former member of the SAFA Great North West and Far North Soccer league, Mr Daniel “Mr System” Magwala, was laid to rest during a well-attended funeral at the Madabani cemetery last Saturday. He died the previous week at his home after a short illness. Magwala, a teacher by occupation, was known for his efforts to help develop young soccer players. During his heyday, he coached Jumbo Powerline. He worked at the Sinthumule Football Association until the soccer associations merged when new municipal demarcations came into place. His son, Mr Papic Magwala, said that the family members were in great pain after losing one of their beloved members. He said the family was proud of having produced “one of the most valuable members of the community.” Papic said that Magwala had played a big role in uplifting the standard of soccer and education in the local community. A member of the Makhado LFA, Mr Scara Tshigomana, described Magwala as a community builder and educator “who was larger than life. He was always there when we needed him. Now that he is gone, we are afraid that no one will ever fill his shoes, because he is irreplaceable.”
