The news of the death of the father of the late South African 800 king, Mbulaheni Mulaudzi, Mr Samuel Mulaudzi (67), has sent shockwaves through the community. He passed away after a short illness at his home at Muduluni on Sunday. The family spokesperson, Mr Lutamo Ramuedzisi, described his death as a big loss to the family. "He was one of a kind, a unique person who was always ready to help every member of his family and whoever came to him for help. We have lost a great father," he added. Ramuedzisi said that messages of condolences from people locally and abroad were pouring in. “Mulaudzi was a people person and accommodating to everyone, irrespective of colour, race and religion,” he said. “He was a visionary and the strategic thinker of the family.” Thovhele Vho-Vele Kutama extended his condolences to the family. He indicated that the royal council and community at large would sorely miss the good working relationship and support they had received from  Mulaudzi. “The role he played in fostering unity, discipline, hard work and dedication within the family and community shall always be cherished,” Kutama said. Mulaudzi is survived by his wife and three children. He will be buried on Saturday at Muduluni and the service will start at 06:00.
