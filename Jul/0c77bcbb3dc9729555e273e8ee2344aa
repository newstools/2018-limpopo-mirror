Nearly 400 initiates from six villages in the Hlanganani area were warmly welcomed back home with song and dance by excited community members at Chavani on Saturday. They were from Mbhokota, Chavani, Nwaxinyamane, Mashamba, Bungeni and Mashau. The initiation school was officially closed last Friday to allow school-going initiates to return home and be ready for the reopening of schools. The family members of the initiates were seen carrying lots of food as welcoming gifts and to congratulate them for moving from boyhood to manhood. All seemed to be in a healthy condition. The 12-year-old Thikho Silahe of Ha- Mashau Bodwe says he requested his parents to give him permission to attend the school, because he wanted to go there. “I am very happy that I went there and graduated. I would not feel like a man if I did not go there, but now I am proud that I went through the same process that my father and forefathers had gone through,” he said. Chief Thomas Mkhari says a good working relationship between initiation school owners, traditional leaders and government was the key to success. He said that he was happy that no one had been reported missing or killed.
