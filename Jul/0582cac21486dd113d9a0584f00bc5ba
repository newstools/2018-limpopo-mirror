The time of sitting in cosy offices, while people are suffering outside, is over. So says Thulamela mayor Cllr Mushoni Tshifhango, as he joined field workers in filling potholes. The mayor led by example last Friday, when he and his executive, office staff and extended public works staff entered the streets filling potholes at worn-out streets in Sibasa. Darned in work suits, the mayor was joined by the senior local traditional leader Thovhele Gole Mphaphuli who also spent most of the day working. About the initiative, mayor Tshifhango said it was in line with the Thuma Mina call by President Cyril Ramaphosa. “The time of sitting in offices only doing paper work is over. Our people need services outside and we do not have to wait for them to complain. We cannot depend on staff outside there, we must go out and give a helping hand where necessary,” he said. He added that they will help with the electricity, water and road challenges facing communities and “we believe together we can do more for our people,” he said. Tshifhango further indicated that they have another programme Hu Duba Buse, which is aimed at improving village streets and many communities would benefit. He said the Thuma Mina programme will also give him time to monitor staff outside and to motivate them. Mr Rendani Mulaudzi, acting senior manager technical services thanked the mayor for his initiative, saying his staff members were very motivated by working alongside the mayor. “This is good leadership, leading by example,” he said.
