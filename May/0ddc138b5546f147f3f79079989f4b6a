The Limpopo Department of Health issued a media statement last Monday, warning community members about imposters who are requesting a sum of money in exchange for job opportunities at the Department of Health. The Department of Health’s spokesperson, Mr Neil Shikwambana, said that some individuals collected lists in communities, claiming to be agents of the Department of Health. “The department wishes to advise community members that jobs are not for sale at the department and at no stage should a person pay any amount of money to qualify for interviews. If at any stage community members come across such offers, they must swiftly report these swindlers and imposters to the police,” Shikwambana added. “To appoint suitable candidates, the department will follow the normal human resource processes. Community members are therefore warned against any imposter who might claim to be acting on behalf of the department,” Shikwambana concluded.
