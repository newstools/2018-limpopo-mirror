King Toni Mphephu Ramabulana has slammed communities and some traditional leaders who have used the media, especially radio, to disgrace the traditional leadership of Vhavenda. “We have to respect our traditional leaders. The customs and traditions of Vhavenda should be promoted. Sometimes, traditional leaders are accused of things that are not their responsibility, like a shortage of water in some villages, which must be directed to municipalities,” said Mphephu Ramabulana. According to him, some listeners used the radio phone-in programmes as platforms to insult and disrespect traditional leaders. He addressed some senior traditional leaders during the communication dialogue that was held in Vhembe District’s legislative assembly on Friday. The dialogue was about how traditional leaders can engage each other on issues affecting them and the communities they are ruling. A representative from the National House of Traditional Leaders, Mr Sam Khandlela, congratulated Mphephu Ramabulana on his leadership, for ruling the Vhavenda people with wisdom and respect. The station manager of Phalaphala FM, Mr Freddy Sadiki, said the station respected the traditional leadership and said they had already started to pay courtesy visits to senior leaders.
