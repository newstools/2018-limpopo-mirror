Hundreds of people gathered at the Mutshusa house on Sunday to pay their last respects to Gogo Motatjo Mutshusa (100) who was buried at the Madabani Graveyard. She was a member of the Apostolic Church of God and was described as a pioneer, a born leader and a woman of vision. She helped everyone, despite their circumstances. “For many years she served selflessly and faithfully in parishes throughout the country, and in those dark days she made herself available day and night to all who needed her,” several of the speakers emphasised. A family representative, Mr Solomon Mutshusa, thanked friends, family members and the community for supporting them in the difficult time. Pastor Steven Mulaudzi of the Apostolic Church of God conducted the funeral sermon.
