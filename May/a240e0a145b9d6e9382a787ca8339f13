It all started last year when Netshituni Coaches and Bus Services, under the stewardship of Ms Lucia Netshituni, hosted the first motivational talk for Luvuvhu Circuit’s Grade 12s. It became a roaring success and the circuit's results improved by a whopping 14%. More than 1000 learners were taken to the venue and fed free of charge by the company, which had also organized motivational speakers, artists and TV celebrities, who took turns in motivating the learners. As if that was not enough, the company hosted the second annual motivational talk for 2018’s group of Grade 12s. It took place at the Christ Worship House on Friday. Present to motivate the learners were the mayor of Vhembe, actors from Muvhango, the evergreen DJ Maphorisa, radio personalities, rhumba maestro Zozo, Vhumbedzi circuit manager Ashifa Shabba, Thovhele Nthumeni Masia and the initiator of the project, Ms Lucia Netshituni. Netshituni said they always strived for excellence and offered the best transport but felt they should once more extend a giving hand and plough back into the community. “We are aiming to empower and guide our Grade 12 students to face the oncoming task as they prepare to write their final examinations. In 2017, we hosted the Luvuvhu Circuit with over 1 000 matriculants, and we are proud to have been key to the 14% increase in their matric pass rate.” This year, the focus was to get scholars from the most disadvantaged and rural schools to find courage in moving towards success, she said. Thovhele Nthumeni Masia commended the company, saying that the project would make learners realise their dreams. He urged the learners to take their education seriously and implored other businesses to follow in Netshituni Coaches’ footsteps.
