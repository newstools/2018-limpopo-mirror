The executive mayor of the Vhembe District Municipality, Cllr Florence Radzilani, has urged ward councillors to serve the communities they represent with commitment and dedication.

Radzilani was speaking during the mayoral imbizo at Gidjamandeni Village in Malamulele last Friday.

Radzilani said ward councillors represented Pres Cyril Ramaphosa and the government in their respective communities. "Whatever you do, you must do it wholeheartedly and serve people with dedication," Radzilani added. "You must be transparent and always be ready to serve the people with commitment. You must always be available and bring solutions whenever there is a need in your communities. If people need water or tar roads, do not swear or be rude to them but be ready to listen and provide solutions to them." She pledged to give two bursaries to performing pupils from disadvantaged families as part of the mayoral bursary scheme. "This year the district managed to give 100 bursaries, " Radzilani said. Chief Hlungwani of the Madonsi Traditional Council applauded Radzilani for having the imbizo at one of his villages.
