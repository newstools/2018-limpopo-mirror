Mourners from all over the province and outside attended the funeral of the Face of Venrap 2016 and artist Humbulani “Humblo” Manenzhe (24). The final-year LLB student at the University of Venda was buried at Kutama last Sunday. She passed away a fortnight ago in the Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital after a short illness. During the event, the sound of hymns was overpowered by weeping followers. Speakers emphasized that she was a fallen hero, who was involved in the battle to uplift young people’s lives. “The pain we experience as a family is more than words can express,” said a family representative, Mr Ntsieni Magwala.

“We thank the community for their support since the tragedy struck us. Your presence and contributions made us strong, although we know the tragedy will ring in our minds for the rest of our lives,” he said. The deputy president of the Univen SRC, Mr Salman Madina Patel, expressed his condolences to the family. He said that she was a student who was eager to learn. He described her as a hardworking young woman who had a broad vision. "We have really lost a young leader in our province and it will be very difficult for us to replace her," he said. Mr Billy Bilankulu described her as a pioneer, a born leader and a young woman of vision. He said the whole community gathered with heavy hearts, because she had been influential in the area.
