The Star Girls organisation will host the Miss Waterval 2018 beauty pageant on Saturday at the Waterval Hall. According to the organiser, Ms Takalani Masuluke, they felt there was a need to teach young people about the value of culture and the importance of restoring it. “Culture and tradition are the foundation on which the prosperity of each nation starts. It is important to continue with initiatives of this nature for the sake of our children. A nation that does not respect its culture is doomed and does not have any direction.” According to Masuluke, the contest is completely different from other beauty contests. The beautiful girls are expected to bring their own traditional attire. She said that people should come in large numbers to see young girls proudly displaying their beauty, wearing xibela and mashedo and other traditional dresses. “Everything at the contest will preferably be African - the food, the girls´ hairstyles and music - it will be purely African,” she said. The winners will get cash and vouchers. The pageant starts at 14:00.
